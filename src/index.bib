abstract = {Classical hypothesis testing focuses on testing whether treatments have differential effects on outcome. However, sometimes clinicians may be more interested in determining whether treatments are equivalent or whether one has noninferior outcomes. We review the hypotheses for these noninferiority and equivalence research questions, consider power and sample size issues, and discuss how to perform such a test for both binary and survival outcomes. The methods are illustrated on 2 recent studies in hematopoietic cell transplantation. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.},

abstract = {Medical research workers are making increasing use of logistic regression analysis for binary and ordinal data. The purpose of this paper is to give a non-technical introduction to logistic regression models for ordinal response variables. We address issues such as the global concept and interpretation of logistic models, the model building procedure from a practical point of view, and the assessment of the model adequacy. For illustrative purposes we apply these methods to real data of a study investigating the association between glycosylated haemoglobin and retinopathy. We give some recommendations for the use and assessment of ordinal logistic regression models in medical research.},
