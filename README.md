This repository contains R code to reproduce the analyses for the manuscript *The effect of donation activity dwarfs the effect of lifestyle, diet and iron supplementation on blood donor iron stores* by Lobier M., Niittymäki P., Castrén J., Palokongas E., Partanen J., and Arvas M. 

The code is included as a single .Rmd file.

The packages and version used for the analysis is included in the packrat .lock file except for the relaimpo package. The appropriate version of the relaimpo package to run this code is available to download directly fromm the package's author's [webpage](http://prof.beuth-hochschule.de/groemping/software/relaimpo/). The code requires the non-US version of the package to run the pmvd analyses. Results were computed using the relaimpo_2.2-3.tar.gz sources. 


For all questions relating to the code, please contact M  Lobier ( muriel (dot) lobier (at) veripalvelu (dot) fi).
